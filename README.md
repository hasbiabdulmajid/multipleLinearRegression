# multipleLinearRegression
 simple multiple linear regression to compare if adding some random variable will have a good impact or not compared with adding relevant variable. This code is extended version of [Simple Regression](https://github.com/hasbiabdulmajid/linearRegression) by adding 1 more variable (column)
 
 ## Reference
 this code is simply by following the Data Science Course by 365 Career
 
 ## Dataset
 - *Multiple linear regression.csv*
 this dataset is contain table with 3 column 'SAT','GPA', and 'Rand 1,2,3'. This dataset is dataset that contain random variable that used in *multipleLinear1.ipynb*
 - *Dummies.csv*
 this dataset is contain table with 3 column 'SAT','GPA', and 'Attendace'. This dataset is dataset that contain relevant variable that used in *multipleLinear2.ipynb*
 
 ## Result
 the *multipleLinear2.ipynb* has better result compare to *multipleLinear1.ipynb* because adding some random variable that not relevant can't make the regression result better
